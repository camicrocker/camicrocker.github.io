    <p>Ostrich, (Struthio camelus), large flightless bird found only in open country in Africa. 
        The largest living bird, an adult male may be 2.75 metres (about 9 feet) tall—almost half of its
height is neck—and weigh more than 150 kg (330 pounds); the female is somewhat smaller.
The ostrich's egg, averaging about 150 mm (6 inches) in length by 125 mm (5 inches) in diameter 
and about 1.35 kg (3 pounds), is also the world's largest. Ostriches are seen individually, in pairs,
in small flocks, or in large aggregations, depending on the season. The ostrich relies on its strong 
legs—uniquely two-toed, with the main toe developed almost as a hoof—to escape its enemies, chiefly 
humans and the larger carnivores. A frightened ostrich can achieve a speed of 72.5 km (45 miles) per 
hour. If cornered, it can deliver dangerous kicks.</p>
